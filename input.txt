The process begins with the leaf nodes containing the probabilities of the symbol they 
represent. Then, the process takes the two nodes with smallest probability, 
and creates a new internal node having these two nodes as children. 
The weight of the new node is set to the sum of the weight of the children. 
We then apply the process again, on the new internal node and on the 
remaining nodes (i.e., we exclude the two leaf nodes), we repeat this process 
until only one node remains, which is the root of the Huffman tree.
